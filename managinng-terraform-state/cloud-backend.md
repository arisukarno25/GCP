## What is cloud backend terraform 
- A Cloud Storage backend stores the state as an object in a configurable prefix in a given bucket on Cloud Storage. This backend also supports state locking. This will lock your state for all operations that could write state. This prevents others from acquiring the lock and potentially corrupting your state.

- State locking happens automatically on all operations that could write state. You won't see any message that it is happening. If state locking fails, Terraform will not continue. You can disable state locking for most commands with the -lock flag, but this is not recommended.
